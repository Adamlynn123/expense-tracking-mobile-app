# Expense Tracker

My project is an expense tracking mobile app that is made with Android Studio in the Kotlin programming language. It has a simple design with great functionality for the user to gauge what they may need to change with their spending habits. This expense tracking mobile app is used for people who want to get a good idea of how they are spending their money. It can be difficult to really see how you spend your money without an idea of what it looks like.
